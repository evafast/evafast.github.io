Welcome to the eva (is) fast and curious blog!

The goal of this blog is to document my ventures in the data science world from a biologist perspective. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in stem cell biology at [HSCRB](https://hscrb.harvard.edu). I study hematopoietic stem cell regeneration and heterogeneity in mouse and zebrafish. I am especially interested how pathways related to immunity such as such as inflammation affect development and regeneration. For my research I use a lot of genomics techniques such as RNAseq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and single-cell RNAseq to study how inflammatory signals affect stem cells. I most enjoy the analysis of these datasets and feel the need to broaden my computational skillset. Most recently I completed the Insight Data Science program which is a great way to deep dive into data science. I am trying to document what I am learning with my blog - hope it's helpful for both Biologists and Computational people alike. Please feel free to send me some thoughts/feedback.
